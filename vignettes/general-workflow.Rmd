Gradebook is asystem to make course grade calculations easy, fast, and most importantly, correct. Course grades are produced from a data frame of assignment grades along with a grading policy file that specifies how they should be weighted when combined into a final grade.
```{r setup}
library(gradebook)
```
## Key Functions
Gradebook uses a series of key functions to calculate course grades. These most general key functions are: `score()`, `aggregation()`, `lateness()`, `drop_n_lowest`. Each key specifies
```{r echo = FALSE}
DiagrammeR::mermaid("graph LR
  Assignments_from_gs --> Score
  Score --> Lateness
  Lateness --> Drop_N_Lowest
  Drop_N_Lowest --> Aggregation
  Aggregation --> Category_Grade
")
```
