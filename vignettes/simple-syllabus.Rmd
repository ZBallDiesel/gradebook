Now, we will walk through a simple syllabus and its Gradebook implementation with 5 students in the class. Start with what this syllabus would look like on a class website.

## Syllabus

The final student's grade is computed from *1) midterm, 2) homework assignments, and 3) the final exam*. Their grade will be computed as follows:

-   Homework 20%
    -   Homework 1, Homework 2 (and they are aggregated equally)
-   Midterm 40%
-   Final Exam 40%

## Policy File

Here is what the policy file looks like:

``` yaml
`r xfun::file_string(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "gradebook"))`
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(gradebook)
yaml::read_yaml(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "gradebook"))
# to be replaced with gradebook::read_policy()
```

## Gradescope Assigments File

Here is what the gradescope assignments file looks like:

::: {style="height: 300px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(simple_syllabus_data)
```
:::

## Workflow

**Overall grade** is calculated using the three categories, with the weights as shown above; This is represented by `Overall Grade` with an aggregation of `weighted_mean`.

The **Midterm** and **Final Exam** categories contain only a single assignment, as shown in the `simple_syllabus_data` file, which is usually downloaded from gradescope.

The **Homework** category is compiled of two assignments: *"Homework 1"* and *"Homework 2"* in the `simple_syllabus_data`.

### Grade Calculations

First, read in your YAML policy file.

```{r}
policy <- yaml::read_yaml(system.file("extdata", "simple_syllabus.yaml", package = "gradebook"))
```

`validate_policy()` checks the formatting of the policy file.

```{r}
policy <- validate_policy(policy, gs = simple_syllabus_data)
```

Finally, `get_grades()` grades your assignments based on your policy file.

```{r}
grades <- get_grades(policy = policy, gs = simple_syllabus_data)
```

The output of the grades looks like:

::: {style="height: 300px; overflow: auto;"}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(grades)
```
:::

Disclaimers:

-   The `weights` of a category with aggregation `weighted_mean` should be corresponding order with the `assignments.`

-   Categories cannot have the same name as any other assignment name.
