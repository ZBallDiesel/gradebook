Now, we will walk through a simple syllabus and its Gradebook implementation. Start with what this syllabus would look like on a class website.

## Syllabus
The entirety of a student's grade is determined by their grades on two midterms and the final exam.
Their grade will be computed as follows:

 - Midterm One 20%
 - Midterm Two 25%
 - Final Exam 55%
 
 ## Policy File
 **insert YAML here**
 
 ## Workflow
 This grade is calculated using three assignments, each weighted as above, so the `aggregation` is `weighted_mean`. The scores for each assignment is calculated by dividing their raw score by their max points.
