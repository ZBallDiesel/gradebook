\arguments{
\item{grades_mat}{Matrix with assignments + associated cols for that category}

\item{policy_line}{Policy list item for that key}

\item{category}{Category name}

\item{assignments}{Assignment names for this category}

\item{weights}{Weights for \code{weighted_mean}}
}
\value{
A matrix with the additional computation from the relevant key function
}
\description{
A collection of functions to refer to correct classification of grading functions using policy file keys.
\itemize{
\item \code{score()} computes the percentage score and saves back into raw-points column (the columnn with the assignment score)
\item \code{aggregation()} computes the aggregated score for each category
\item \code{lateness()} applies any relevant lateness penalty within the given thresholds.
\item \code{drop_n_lowest()} drops n lowest assignment scores; if n >= num of assignments, returns highest assignment score
\item \code{aggregation_max_pts()} computes the maximum possible points for each category.
\item \code{aggregation_lateness()} computes the aggregated lateness for each category.
